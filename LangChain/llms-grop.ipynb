      "content='As an historian expert in the Abdul Kalam family, I must admit that my expertise lies in the life and legacy of Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, the former President of India. However, I can try to provide some information about JFK, although it may not be directly related to my area of expertise.\\n\\nOne curious thing about JFK is that he was a best-selling author before he became the President of the United States. In 1940, at the age of 23, Kennedy wrote a book called \"Why England Slept,\" which was a analysis of the events leading up to World War II. The book became a best-seller, and it helped establish Kennedy as a rising star in American politics.\\n\\nIt\\'s interesting to note that Kennedy\\'s literary talents were encouraged by his father, Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., who was a diplomat and a businessman. Kennedy\\'s writing skills would later serve him well in his political career, as he was known for his eloquent speeches and his ability to communicate complex ideas in a clear and concise manner.\\n\\nNow, if you\\'d like to know more about Dr. Abdul Kalam\\'s literary contributions or his legacy as a scientist and statesman, I\\'d be happy to share my expertise with you!' additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 253, 'prompt_tokens': 56, 'total_tokens': 309, 'completion_time': 1.274050338, 'prompt_time': 0.01343386, 'queue_time': 0.016653567, 'total_time': 1.287484198}, 'model_name': 'llama-3.3-70b-versatile', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_c0cfa69934', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='run-e808d985-2d52-4a66-86dc-2c125446723d-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 56, 'output_tokens': 253, 'total_tokens': 309}\n"
